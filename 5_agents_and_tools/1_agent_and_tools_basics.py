Example about create agent with tool
    Agent have some characteristics like: 
        Perception: (ability to get information through it sensor)
        Reasoning: ability to have logical thinking
        Decision-making: ability to make decision base on perception, reasoning to make decision
        Action: ability to take action base on decision-making
    create_react_agent:
        is function which to create agent with input parameter
            llm: reasoning capability
            prompt: conext
            tools: actions or ability to ack
    AgentExecutor
        a class which help to create agent executor to manage agent state
    Tool
        a class which help to create tool instance
Example context
